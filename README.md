# pokemonHA
pokemon simulator for Home-Assistant.io

Use config.txt to see the example config for HA.
Both the `playername` and `enemyname` are optional. If you don't use them Ash & Gary will be used.

The following entities will be added:
- pokemon.battle (the entity in which you'll see the current activity of the battle between both persons)
- pokemon.enemy and pokemon.player (both will the trainer card of the player and the enemy)
- pokemon.pokemon1player ... pokemon.pokemon6player (the 6 pokemon of the player)
- pokemon.pokemon1enemy ... pokemon.pokemon6enemy (the 6 pokemon of the enemy)

Each victory will give a trainer a badge. Each 8 badges will unlock the next generation of pokemon.

The pokedex will display the amount of unique pokemon a trainer has used.

At the beginning of each battle all fainted pokemon that haven't won a battle will be replaced by new randomly choosen pokemon. The not fainted pokemon will go up one level and that will make their attacks stronger.
